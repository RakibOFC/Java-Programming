Able to make acrobatic and memorable saves, most lasting memories of Navas are of him stretched out horizontally, getting his hands to the ball to tip it round the post. He is responsive in the sense that he tends to get better the more he is tested, though is not quite of the refined, well-rounded breed of goalkeeper that has been preferred in recent years.</p><p><b>High point of 2021:</b> Even after PSG won 4-1 win at Camp Nou, there was a moment in the <a href="/football/league/_/name/uefa.champions">Champions League</a> last-16 second leg in Paris when it looked like <a href="/football/team?id=83">Barcelona</a> might get back into the tie. However, Navas saved from a <a href="https://www.espn.in/football/player/_/id/266291/Sergiño-Dest">Sergino Dest</a> drive and <a href="https://www.espn.in/football/player/_/id/45843/Lionel-Messi">Lionel Messi</a>'s penalty to ensure that did not happen.</p><hr><img class="floatleft imageLoaded" height="250px" src="https://a.espncdn.com/photo/2021/1118/r939293_864x1296_2-3.jpg"><h2>9. <a href="https://www.espn.in/football/player/_/id/158626/Emiliano-Martínez">Emiliano Martinez</a></h2><p><b>Club / country:</b> <a href="/football/team?id=362">Aston Villa</a> / <a href="/football/team?id=202">Argentina</a><br /><b>Age:</b> 29<br /><b>2020 rank:</b> Not ranked</p><p><strong>Scouting report: </strong>Given that Martinez has only completed one full season as a first-choice goalkeeper, and looked average until picked up by Aston Villa, the Argentina No. 1 is making a mark as a late bloomer. Low on confidence after failing to get a chance during an eight year career at <a href="/football/team?id=359">Arsenal</a>, he made the move to Villa and hasn't looked back. His well-publicised antics in resorting to any method possible to put off an attacker when faced with penalties (he's saved four this season) grab the headlines, but Martinez is a solid and reliable shot stopper.</p><p><b>High point of 2021:</b> Martinez only earned his first Argentina cap in June but quickly became a hero in his homeland with Golden Glove-winning Copa America form. He produced a hat trick of saves in the semifinal penalty shootout win over <a href="/football/team?id=208">Colombia</a>, then kept a clean sheet in a 1-0 final win against <a href="/football/team?id=205">Brazil</a>.</p><hr><img class="floatleft imageLoaded" height="250px" src="https://a.espncdn.com/photo/2021/1118/r939292_864x1296_2-3.jpg"><h2>8. <a href="https://www.espn.in/football/player/_/id/140740/Marc-André-ter-Stegen">Marc-Andre ter Stegen</a></h2><p><b>Club / country:</b> Barcelona / <a href="/football/team?id=481">Germany</a><br /><b>Age:</b> 29<br /><b>2020 rank:</b> 4</p><p><strong>Scouting report: </strong>Though not quite as impressive as previous seasons, the Germany international is still among the top goalkeepers in the game. As is compulsory for any Barcelona goalkeeper, Ter Stegen is always available for his defenders and contributes in moving the ball around at the back well. Blessed with rapid reflexes, he has generally proved to have good timing when rushing off his line to stop an attacker. He's also good at restarting play through long, precise throws.</p><p><b>High point of 2021:</b> Ter Stegen came up with a huge performance against <a href="/football/team?id=243">Sevilla</a> in the Copa del Rey semifinal, saving a penalty from <a href="https://www.espn.in/football/player/_/id/159263/Lucas-Ocampos">Lucas Ocampos</a> as Barca overturned a 2-0 first-leg deficit to reach the final.

At 6-foot-4, not only does the Senegal international's reach give him an edge at catching crosses, but he's also deceptively quick at getting down to make low saves on both sides. Increasingly composed and measured in his distribution, from which he often starts attacks, he has become a key component of Chelsea's defence.</p><p><b>High point of 2021:</b> Mendy almost single-handedly earned Chelsea three points at <a href="/football/team?id=337">Brentford</a> in October. He made seven stunning saves in a 1-0 win, prompting manager Thomas Tuchel to call him "absolutely decisive" and left-back <a href="https://www.espn.in/football/player/_/id/225426/Ben-Chilwell">Ben Chilwell</a> to say: "We have [Mendy] to thank, he was amazing."</p><hr><img class="floatleft imageLoaded" height="250px" src="https://a.espncdn.com/photo/2021/1118/r939290_864x1296_2-3.jpg"><h2>6. <a href="https://www.espn.in/football/player/_/id/176948/Ederson">Ederson</a></h2><p><b>Club / country: </b><a href="/football/team?id=382">Manchester City</a> / Brazil<br /><b>Age:</b> 28<br /><b>2020 rank:</b> 6</p><p><strong>Scouting report: </strong>One of the closest rivals to Manuel Neuer when it comes to the quality of his first touch and distribution, Ederson is fundamental to Pep Guardiola's brand of football at Manchester City. The Brazilian's left-footed strike is arguably the cleanest and most powerful among goalkeepers at the highest level (he'd probably have a go at taking direct free-kicks, if he was allowed to). The occasions he gets caught out due to concentration lapses are getting fewer and is now a complete player with a knack for saving penalties.</p><p><b>High point of 2021:</b> There are few goalkeepers with Ederson's vision and distribution, which is so important to a Guardiola side. An example of his brilliance was seen in May when he played a 60-yard pass in the build-up to City's opening goal in the Champions League semifinal second leg against PSG.</p><hr><img class="floatleft imageLoaded" height="250px" src="https://a.espncdn.com/photo/2021/1118/r939289_864x1296_2-3.jpg"><h2>5. <a href="https://www.espn.in/football/player/_/id/196876/Alisson">Alisson</a></h2><p><b>Club / country:</b> Liverpool / Brazil<br /><b>Age:</b> 29<br /><b>2020 rank: </b>2</p><p><strong>Scouting report: </strong>An attack-minded, brave goalkeeper whose excellent game-reading skills and general alertness make him capable of performing a high number of interceptions. Very offensive in the way he defends his goal; always on the front foot and off his line quickly. The Brazilian is very capable with his feet, agile and transmits confidence to his defenders with his vocal, active style.</p><p><b>High point of 2021:</b> In May, Liverpool's Premier League top-four hopes were in jeopardy when Alisson joined his teammates in the West Bromwich Albion penalty area. One flicked header later, the goalkeeper had scored an improbable winner that helped seal a Champions League place.</p><hr><img class="floatleft imageLoaded" height="250px" src="https://a.espncdn.com/photo/2021/1118/r939288_784x1176_2-3.jpg"><h2>4. <a href="https://www.espn.in/football/player/_/id/134283/Thibaut-Courtois">Thibaut Courtois</a></h2><p><b>Club / country:</b> <a href="/football/team?id=86">Real Madrid</a> / <a href="/football/team?id=459">Belgium</a><br /><b>Age:</b> 29<br /><b>2020 rank:</b> 5</p><p><strong>Scouting report: </strong>At 6-foot-7, Courtois is one of the tallest goalkeepers at elite level and his presence in goal makes him hard to beat. The Belgium international, who is closing in on his 100th cap, is incredibly consistent and hardly ever misses a game or commits glaring errors. Excellent at catching crosses, he's impressively acrobatic for his size and has fine instinctive reflexes. His footwork might not rate the highest, but it's improving.</p><p><b>High point of 2021:</b> Perhaps Courtois' best performance of the year came earlier this season in a 1-0 Champions League win for Madrid at Inter. His fine saves denied a goalbound <a href="https://www.espn.in/football/player/_/id/219713/Lautaro-Martínez">Lautaro Martinez</a> header, as well as two efforts from <a href="https://www.espn.in/football/player/_/id/102337/Edin-Dzeko">Edin Dzeko</a>, as <i>Los Blancos</i> sneaked the three points.</p><hr><img class="floatleft imageLoaded" height="250px" src="https://a.espncdn.com/photo/2021/1118/r939287_864x1296_2-3.jpg"><h2>3. <a href="https://www.espn.in/football/player/_/id/84774/Manuel-Neuer">Manuel Neuer</a></h2><p><b>Club / country:</b> Bayern Munich / Germany<br /><b>Age:</b> 35<br /><b>2020 rank:</b> 1</p><p><strong>Scouting report: </strong>The original "sweeper keeper" is still among the best in the game when it comes to footwork. Few other goalkeepers are as comfortable in dealing with the ball at their feet. Whether it's short or medium passes with the right pace and angles, pinpointing a long diagonal or even spotting a run in behind, Neuer can do it all. He pushes up when his team is in possession like no other goalkeeper, while his reflexes and game-reading skills are still of the very highest order.</p><p><b>High point of 2021:</b> Neuer is a modern goalkeeper, in that his ability on the ball remains as important as his shot stopping. As such, it was no great shock to see him arrow a 60-yard pass to set up a Champions League goal for <a href="https://www.espn.in/football/player/_/id/125824/Robert-Lewandowski">Robert Lewandowski</a> against <a href="/football/team?id=1929">Benfica</a> in November.</p><hr><img class="floatleft imageLoaded" height="250px" src="https://a.espncdn.com/photo/2021/1118/r939286_864x1296_2-3.jpg"><h2>2. <a href="https://www.espn.in/football/player/_/id/217092/Gianluigi-Donnarumma">Gianluigi Donnarumma</a></h2><p><b>Club / country:</b> Paris Saint-Germain (moved from <a href="/football/team?id=103">AC Milan</a> in July) / <a href="/football/team?id=162">Italy</a><br /><b>Age:</b> 22<br /><b>2020 rank:</b> 8</p><p><strong>Scouting report: </strong>In addition to having the size and presence to command his area, the Italy international is technically brilliant. While initially recognised for his sharp reflexes on the line, his ability to time and execute his closing down of an on-rushing opponent is now his trademark. Donnarumma's distribution has also improved steadily over the past few seasons, to the point where he's confident enough to be used by his defenders to play away from pressure, as has his ability to get his hands safely on crosses.</p><p><b>High point of 2021:</b> The 6-feet-5 stopper used every inch of his frame to become Italy's Euro 2020 penalty king. He saved from Alvaro Morata to help secure a place in the final, then kept out further penalties from <a href="https://www.espn.in/football/player/_/id/259836/Jadon-Sancho">Jadon Sancho</a> and <a href="https://www.espn.in/football/player/_/id/280555/Bukayo-Saka">Bukayo Saka</a> in the shootout win over <a href="/football/team?id=448">England</a>.</p><hr><img class="floatleft imageLoaded" height="250px" src="https://a.espncdn.com/photo/2021/1118/r939285_864x1296_2-3.jpg"><h2>1. <a href="https://www.espn.in/football/player/_/id/149622/Jan-Oblak">Jan Oblak</a></h2><p><b>Club / country:</b> <a href="/football/team?id=1068">Atletico Madrid</a> / <a href="/football/team/_/id/472/slovenia">Slovenia</a><br /><b>Age:</b> 28<br /><b>2020 rank:</b> 3</p><p><strong>Scouting report: </strong>In contrast to the trend of "sweeper keeper," the Slovenia international is all about the bread and butter of goalkeeping: stopping goals. Aside from his distribution under pressure, Oblak is the complete No. 1: equipped with strong hands and exceptional agility. He positions himself extremely well (including when rushing out) and his concentration and reflexes are so sharp that he can even reshape his body to keep out a late deflection. A world-class goalkeeper and deserving of the No. 1 spot here.</p><p><b>High point of 2021:</b> A fingertip save from Lionel Messi at Camp Nou in May was perhaps the most crucial stop Oblak made this year. It ensured the game ended goalless, earning Atletico a point at the business end of the season and serving a major blow to Barcelona's hopes of winning LaLiga.</p><div data-behavior="video_scroll" class="contentItem__content contentItem__content--media-card contentItem__content--fullWidth contentItem__content--inline"><figure  data-video="native,640,360,4534388" data-cerebro-id="61a4fe37be6ab3105a1cce85" class="media-wrapper_image video" data-source="intl"><picture  class="media-wrapper_image" ><source data-srcset="https://a1.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fmedia%2Fmotion%2FESPNi%2F2021%2F1129%2Fint_211129_Why_FC_100_winner_Jan_Oblak_had_to_be_a_goalkeeper%2Fint_211129_Why_FC_100_winner_Jan_Oblak_had_to_be_a_goalkeeper.jpg&w=640&h=360&cquality=80&format=jpg" media="(min-width: 376px)"><source data-srcset="https://a1.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fmedia%2Fmotion%2FESPNi%2F2021%2F1129%2Fint_211129_Why_FC_100_winner_Jan_Oblak_had_to_be_a_goalkeeper%2Fint_211129_Why_FC_100_winner_Jan_Oblak_had_to_be_a_goalkeeper.jpg&w=335&cquality=80, https://a1.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fmedia%2Fmotion%2FESPNi%2F2021%2F1129%2Fint_211129_Why_FC_100_winner_Jan_Oblak_had_to_be_a_goalkeeper%2Fint_211129_Why_FC_100_winner_Jan_Oblak_had_to_be_a_goalkeeper.jpg&w=670&cquality=40&format=jpg 2x" media="(max-width: 375px)"><img  class=" lazyload lazyload"  ></picture><span class="video-play-button" data-id="4534388">play</span><figcaption class="media-caption"><div class="media-duration">1:35</div></figcaption></figure><div class="contentItem__contentWrapper"><h1 class="contentItem__title contentItem__title--media">Why FC 100 winner Jan Oblak had to be a goalkeeper</h1><p class="contentItem__subhead">Jan Oblak says it was always his dream to be a goalkeeper after being named best in the world in the ESPN FC 100.</p></div></div><p><a name="rightback"></a></p><p><b><a href="#restartfc100">Click here to go back to the top</a></b></p><img src="https://a.espncdn.com/i/mlb/infographics/greyline.png" width="100%"><h2>RIGHT-BACK</h2><aside class="inline inline-photo full"><figure><picture ><source data-srcset="https://a1.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2021%2F1123%2Fr941553_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg&w=570&format=jpg, https://a1.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2021%2F1123%2Fr941553_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg&w=1140&cquality=40&format=jpg 2x" media="(min-width: 376px)"><source data-srcset="https://a1.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2021%2F1123%2Fr941553_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg&w=375, https://a1.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2021%2F1123%2Fr941553_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg&w=750&cquality=40&format=jpg 2x" media="(max-width: 375px)"><img  class=" lazyload lazyload" data-image-container=".inline-photo" height=320 width=570 ></picture><figcaption class="photoCaption"><cite>Illustration by ESPN</cite></figcaption></figure></aside><p>Perhaps once the least-skilled outfield players, right-backs now are often converted wingers, who bring boldness and unpredictability.

He's good in the air for a wide defender, tackles well and is composed on the ball. A very useful team player who keeps on steadily improving.</p><p><b>High point of 2021:</b> Pavard won the Bundesliga with Bayern Munich and was part of France's UEFA Nations League-winning side.

His ability to read and anticipate the game makes him capable of winning most of his duels, he rarely looks in trouble and takes care of his tasks in an expert manner. A respected leader too.</p><p><b>High point of 2021:</b> Lifting the Champions League trophy as Chelsea captain was a career peak for a consistent competitor and his club form also saw Azpilicueta deservedly return to the Spain team after a three-year absence; he played a key role in <i>La Roja</i>'s run to the Euro 2020 semifinals.</p><hr><img class="floatleft imageLoaded" height="250px" src="https://a.espncdn.com/photo/2021/1119/r939410_400x600_2-3.jpg"><h2>8. <a href="https://www.espn.in/football/player/_/id/213248/Denzel-Dumfries">Denzel Dumfries</a></h2><p><b>Club / country:</b> <a href="/football/team/_/id/110/internazionale">Inter Milan</a> (moved from <a href="/football/team?id=148">PSV Eindhoven</a> in August) / <a href="/football/team?id=449">Netherlands</a><br /><b>Age:</b> 25<br /><b>2020 rank:</b> Not ranked</p><p><strong>Scouting report: </strong>The Netherlands wing-back drew plaudits with some impressive performances during Euro 2020 this summer, scoring two goals in the process.

The tall, elegant centre-back plays with such authority that it's quite fascinating to watch (though he can be too nonchalant at times.)</p><p><b>High point of 2021:</b> He loves a late winner against Juventus, and his tap-in sealed a comeback Napoli victory in September.

In other words, the Austria international has the intuition of a defender, the vertical running power of a midfielder and a striker's finish (let alone leadership and determination which any player would want.) It's hard to pick out a similarly tactically adaptable player at the highest level over the past 30 years. No matter if he starts the game in the heart of defence, on the left wing or as a playmaker in midfield, Alaba performs his duties with great quality and intelligence.</p><p><b>High point of 2021:</b> What better way is there to make yourself a hero to Real Madrid fans than by scoring against Barcelona on your <i>Clasico </i>debut?

He's alert enough to position himself well for rebounds or crosses when the attack is on the opposite flank, while his opportunism sees him make productive runs past his marker to look for a finish at the back post. For all his impressive off-the-ball movement, Gosens is also an exceptionally determined footballer and many of his goals are scored out of the sheer will to get to the ball first.</p><p><b>High point of 2021:</b> Gosens was a bright spot at a disappointing Euro 2020 for Germany. Playing as a wing-back in a 4-2 victory over Portugal that was one of the tournament's best games, he scored one, made another and generally did as he pleased against opponents with no answer to his marauding runs.</p><hr><img class="floatleft imageLoaded" height="250px" src="https://a.espncdn.com/photo/2021/1119/r939653_864x1296_2-3.jpg"></p><h2>7. <a href="https://www.espn.in/football/player/_/id/146127/Marcos-Alonso">Marcos Alonso</a></h2><p><b>Club / country:</b> Chelsea / Spain<br /><b>Age:</b> 30<br /><b>2020 rank: </b>Not ranked</p><p><strong>Scouting report: </strong>An intelligent full-back whose incisive forward runs often open up several attacking options.

He can also strike a wonderful free kick.</p><p><b>High point of 2021:</b> Alonso fell out with Frank Lampard and seemed on his way out of Chelsea, but has been a key cog in Thomas Tuchel's finely-tuned machine.

Physically robust and imposing, Hernandez's impact on the game increases as it opens up for transitions and duels at either end of the pitch (where he mostly comes out victorious). Attack-minded and fearless, perhaps too much at times as he frequently ends up in the referee's book.</p><p><b>High point of 2021:</b> After France recovered from falling two goals down in the Nations League semifinal against Belgium, Hernandez found himself with time and space on the edge of the box to fire home a spectacular late winner.

Among the quickest players at elite level football, the Canada international is tremendously fast both over the first few meters and also on longer sprints. The technically sound defender practically owns his flank and is avid in his team's pressing game -- often winning the ball in advanced positions, or making use of his first-class dribbling skills when space opens up to attack.</p><p><b>High point of 2021:</b> Davies has been pivotal in Canada's attempt to reach the 2022 World Cup. He made a point-saving goal against the U.S. in September and then, a month later against <a href="/football/team?id=2659">Panama</a>, reached a speed of 23 mph in an 80-yard sprint, then beat several defenders before scoring a ridiculous goal.</p><hr><img class="floatleft imageLoaded" height="250px" src="https://a.espncdn.com/photo/2021/1119/r939416_400x600_2-3.jpg"></p><h2>1. <a href="https://www.espn.in/football/player/_/id/104943/Andy-Robertson">Andy Robertson</a></h2><p><b>Club / country:</b> Liverpool / <a href="/football/team?id=580">Scotland</a><br /><b>Age:</b> 27<br /><b>2020 rank:</b> 1</p><p><strong>Scouting report: </strong>Not only does the Scotland international score highly in terms of quality, but he's also among the very best when it comes to quantity.

Blessed with fine technical abilities, varied passing (93% accuracy in 2021), as well as excellent vision and understanding of the game, De Jong still has room to exercise even more authority and decisiveness on his game. He advances well with the ball and is a quick thinker who is well suited to Barcelona's style of play.</p><p><b>High point of 2021:</b> De Jong was everywhere in April's Copa del Rey final as Barcelona crushed <a href="/football/team?id=93">Athletic Bilbao</a>.

Gundogan is a highly intelligent footballer with an extraordinary timing to his actions, whether in his own movement or his passes to teammates.</p><p><b>High point of 2021:</b> Gundogan unexpectedly became City's main goal source from midfield in the club's title push.

It can seem as if the ball is drawn to him when he receives it, then feeds his companions with perfectly weighted passes. Modric's vision is acute and he always plays with his head up, while his dribbling skills and ball control are also world-class.</p><p><b>High point of 2021:</b> Modric remains one of LaLiga's best midfielders, but his Euro 2020 performance against Scotland stood out.

Pedri is both so well-developed and naturally talented that it's hard to find any weaknesses in his game; his distribution is quick, crisp and positive (1.25 key passes per game in 2021), he's tactically smart and has the discipline to win defensive challenges and track back to cover for full-backs who have moved forward.</p><p><b>High point of 2021:</b> A key figure in Spain's run to the semifinals at Euro 2020, Pedri he was named Young Player of the Tournament.

Not only does he cover large areas of the pitch, which is priceless for pressing purposes, he also puts in an impressive average of 16 challenges per game -- of which he comes out victorious on 60% of occasions (2021). He also wins a fair share of his aerial battles, intercepts well and generally takes no prisoners in 50-50 situations.

The Italy international is excellent at controlling the pace of the game, often circulating the ball across the defence while waiting to find the right options in midfield. His excellent touch and ability to control/progress with the ball make him hard to dispossess, while he is often a target for pressing and fouls. Verratti has an excellent range of passing and though he doesn't score too much, he's an expert free-kick taker.</p><p><b>High point of 2021:</b> Verratti returned from injury at Euro 2020 against <a href="/football/team?id=578">Wales</a> and was arguably the best player on the pitch, having more touches (136), completing more passes (103) and creating more chances (5) than anyone else.

When not in possession he presses and closes down relentlessly, nipping in before the opponent to pick up loose balls, and his tireless effort can be documented in the high number of short sprints he performs every game. Silva also seems to have improved technically and tactically with an added variety and creativity in his passing game. Increasingly becoming a big-game player for Manchester City, he has been used in a host of different positions up front this season.</p><p><b>High point of 2021:</b> It might only have been against Burnley, but so good was Silva in an October win that Pep Guardiola was compelled to say he had reached the "out of this world" level of his debut 2018-19 campaign.

With his ability to set up effective interchanges and combinations, as well as take on opponents (or even finish from distance), the midfielder is at his most dangerous when progressing with the ball in the final third. Without the ball he's diligent in his pressing game and is always looking to quickly regain possession.</p><p><b>High point of 2021:</b> Ahead of Norwich's visit to Chelsea in October, Mount had not registered a goal or assist in the 2021-22 season. Ninety minutes later, he had the match ball having notched his first career hat trick, which included a superb drive from the edge of the box.

Perhaps a move to another club will help define a clearer role for him than what is now the case at Old Trafford.</p><p><b>High point of 2021:</b> Four assists in a Man United win over Leeds was a remarkable feat, but Pogba's best performance of the year came for France against Germany at Euro 2020.

Though he hardly ever does anything flashy, most of his involvements are clear, precise and with purpose. He is also an excellent communicator and quite a character off the field too.</p><p><b>High point of 2021:</b> Perhaps Muller's greatest moment was his Germany recall. After being ignored by Joachim Low for three years, Muller's club form led to his comeback against Denmark on June 2 -- 927 days since his previous national-team game -- and he has remained integral under Hansi Flick.</p><hr><img class="floatleft imageLoaded" height="250px" src="https://a.espncdn.com/photo/2021/1118/r938946_400x600_2-3.jpg"></p><h2>2. <a href="https://www.espn.in/football/player/_/id/124091/Bruno-Fernandes">Bruno Fernandes</a></h2><p><b>Club / country:</b> Manchester United / Portugal<br /><b>Age:</b> 27<br /><b>2020 rank:</b> 3</p><p><strong>Scouting report: </strong>The Portugal international arrived with tremendous impact two years ago, immediately scoring and providing assists in high quantities. He netted 28 goals in 58 games across all competitions last season, though recently Fernandes has found it hard to reproduce that form.

A hard-working wide man, Oyarzabal can operate as a traditional winger on the left or cut infield from the right. The Real Sociedad captain is difficult to knock off the ball and is an efficient finisher when moving into central areas (he even scores from the odd header). He is also a free-kick specialist.</p><p><b>High point of 2021:</b> He helped Spain reach the Euro 2020 semifinals, scored in the Olympic men's and UEFA Nations League finals and is riding high with Real Sociedad in LaLiga, but Oyarzarbal's standout moment was the penalty that settled an all-Basque Copa del Rey final to earn La Real's first major trophy since 1987.</p><hr><img class="floatleft imageLoaded" height="250px" src="https://a.espncdn.com/photo/2021/1118/r939351_400x600_2-3.jpg"></p><h2>7. <a href="https://www.espn.in/football/player/_/id/172850/Jack-Grealish">Jack Grealish</a></h2><p><b>Club / country:</b> Manchester City (moved from Aston Villa in August) / England<br /><b>Age:</b> 26<br /><b>2020 rank:</b> 10 (attacking midfield)</p><p><strong>Scouting report: </strong>Grealish is yet to hit the highs from his Aston Villa days after his £100m move to Manchester City this summer. More of a playmaker used out wide than a natural winger, Grealish is exceptionally good on the ball and plays football with natural intuition. By being able to beat his opponents with quick, creative footwork or clever one-twos, it's easy to see why the England international is highly rated by City boss Guardiola for his capacity to create numerical advantages in key attacking areas.

He strikes the ball with massive power and can score from well outside the penalty area, even on direct free-kicks.</p><p><b>High point of 2021:</b> This was the breakout year Isak has been waiting for. He flourished at Real Sociedad, scoring 17 league goals last season and winning his first silverware with the club, the Copa del Rey.

Kane is not just a superb finisher with both feet (he scores from outside the penalty area even with his weaker foot) and a terrific aerial game, he also operates well outside the box by finding the right spaces between the lines. Last season he dropped deeper and made 14 assists in the league, while still scoring 23 goals himself, and can bring his teammates into prime attacking positions by way of quick touches, lay-offs and flicks, generally performed with high tempo and precision.

Nearly impossible to catch when running on to a pass with space ahead, he has also developed his game as a goal poacher and makes some terrific decisions in the box. He is hard to beat in the air, while he improved his first touch and ability to play with his back to goal during his time in Italy.</p><p><b>High point of 2021:</b> Lukaku got his dream move, returning to Chelsea seven years after his first stint in London ended.

While his hunger to play off the shoulder of defenders will always be there, he has improved his touch on the ball, his lay-offs are more precise, his headers are directed with more purpose and he seems to have enlarged his vision of the game around him.

He excels through perfect positioning, coolness of execution (usually with one or two touches) and resourceful use of his head, or either foot. The Poland international maps out his immediate surroundings before receiving the ball and makes the best decision to proceed. His physical strength, movement and fine first touch make him a first-class hold-up player, while he scored an incredible 22 consecutive goals from an uninterrupted run of 14 games earlier in the year.</p><p><b>High point of 2021:</b> "LewanGOALski" broke Gerd Müller's 49-year record for goals scored in a single Bundesliga season, doing so even faster than the Bayern legend, notching 41 goals in just 29 matches, or 1.41 goals per game.

For all the weaknesses of man-management and communication that his detractors throw at him, Emery obviously knows how to prepare teams mentally ahead of big games and his brand of football (when it works) is nothing short of spectacular.</p><p><b>High point of 2021:</b> Emery's mastery of the Europa League continued when Villarreal's 11-10 penalty shootout triumph over Man United saw him win the trophy for a fourth time.

Nagelsmann, who began his career as a head coach at the age of 28, has by and large stuck with the 4-2-3-1 formation but has made a free-flowing team even sharper and smoother.
